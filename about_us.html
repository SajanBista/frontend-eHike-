        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            eHike was born from a shared love of the outdoors. Frustrated by the lack of a comprehensive online resource for hikers, we decided to create our own. We started small, with a simple website and a handful of local trail guides. Over time, thanks to the support of our growing community, we have expanded our reach to include trails all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>We are constantly working to improve eHike and add new features. We value your feedback and encourage you to get in touch with any suggestions or comments.</p>
